# Hackathon2k17

<h1>Welcome Hackers!</h1>

If you're seeing this page, you're probably at the CNY hackathon. If not, idk how you got here. 

Here are some tools I compiled, and some scripts I wrote literally the night before the hackathon. Hopefully it'll help keep our networks 
safe and services online. I've never tried anything like this before, so we'll see how it goes!

Good luck and happy hacking
