# Hackathon2k17

<h1>Welcome Hackers!</h1>

<h3>If you're seeing this page, you're probably at the CNY hackathon. If not, idk how you got here. 

Here are some tools I compiled, and some scripts I wrote literally the night before the hackathon. Hopefully it'll help keep our networks 
safe and services online. I've never tried anything like this before, so we'll see how it goes!

A few notes: </h3>
	<h2><ul>
	<li>The scripts here have been tested on a CentOS system</li>
	<li>There is no warranty</li>
	<li>I am <bold>NOT</bold> responsible if the 'powers that be' determine this to be cheating, use at your own risk</li>
	<li>The IP scripts WILL overwrite any contents you have in the corresponding files that they edit. </li>
	</ul></h2>
<h3>Good luck and happy hacking
