# Hackathon2k17

<h1>Welcome Hackers!</h1>

<h3>If you're seeing this page, you're probably at the CNY hackathon. If not, idk how you got here. 

Here are some tools I compiled, and some scripts I wrote literally the night before the hackathon. Hopefully it'll help keep our networks 
safe and services online. I've never tried anything like this before, so we'll see how it goes!

A few notes: </h3>
	<h2><ul>
	<li>The scripts here have been tested on a CentOS system</li>
	<li>There is no warranty</li>
	<li>I am <bold>NOT</bold> responsible if the 'powers that be' determine this to be cheating, use at your own risk</li>
	<li>The IP scripts WILL overwrite any contents you have in the corresponding files that they edit. </li>
	<li>AutoSnort should only be run by team capitans. It is complex and <ins>WILL</ins> break your system if not set up correctly. <sup><sup><sub>Thankfully I set it up already. Capitans just run autosnort-CentOS-11-02-2014.sh</sub></sup></sup></li>
	<li>These scripts need to be run as root. Risky, yes, but they need to modify system files to do your job for you. You'll thank me later.</li>
	</ul></h2>
